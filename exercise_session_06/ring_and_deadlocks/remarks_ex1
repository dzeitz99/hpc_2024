WHen runnning the script, there have to be two spaces between each rank because while one rank is sending / receviving from his nighbour, his neighbour cannot send while receviving from the neighbor rank. Since they are waiting for each other, this causes deadlock. Treating even and odd ranks separately ensures that there is always one rank in between as every odd rank is surrounded by even ranks which prevents deadlocking. This approach is not optimal as the ranks are now out of order. By using Isend/Irecv/waitall each process can do both sending and receiving while waiting for all processes to finish before proceeding, so that deadlocks can be prevented. However I am still not sure why the processes are not in order, the processes should be 0,1,2,3.
