Exercise 1:
The permissions of my home directory are drwxr-xr-x and my scratch directory has the permissions drwxr-x---+.
I can not access other users home directories but I can go to other users scratch directories. I should not be able to modify someones files but if i want to exchange some files i should be able to access a scratch directory where both have access to. I cannot create a new file in someone elses scratch but i can do it in my scratch and the file has permissions -rw-r--r--+, so i can write it and others in my group can read it. A new file in my home has the permissions 
-rw-r--r--.
I cannot access or see the permissions of hknierim , so if there is a file in his directory I don't think that I can access it.
If i want to change the permissions so that only i have full access to the directory i can do chmod 700 directory , if I want the group or others to have read and execute i can do chmod 705 directory .
The permissions 000 allow me to open the file however I can only read it and not write anything, so the file is not lost.

Exercise 2:
1) "00$"
2) "^1.*1$" 
3) ".*110.*"
4) -E "(.1*){3,}"
5) -E "(.111*)"
